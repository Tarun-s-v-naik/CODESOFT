Simple Calculator

Overview

This repository contains a simple calculator program implemented in C++. The calculator performs basic arithmetic operations, including addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division. It allows the user to continuously perform calculations until they choose to exit.

How It Works

Input Numbers:

The program prompts the user to input two numbers.

Operation Selection:

The user selects an operation from the following options:

Addition (+)

Subtraction (-)

Multiplication (*)

Division (/)

Perform Calculation:

The program performs the selected operation and displays the result.

If division is selected and the second number is zero, the program alerts the user and sets the result to zero.

Continue or Exit:

The user decides whether to continue using the calculator or exit the program by entering 1 to continue or 0 to stop.

Features

Basic Arithmetic Operations: Addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division.

Error Handling: Prevents division by zero with a warning message.

Continuous Mode: Allows the user to perform multiple calculations in a single session.

Notes

Ensure proper input (numbers and operation choice) to avoid unexpected behavior.

The program uses an infinite loop (for(;;)) to continuously prompt the user until they choose to exit.
