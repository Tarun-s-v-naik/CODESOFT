XO Tic-Tac-Toe Game

Overview

This repository contains a console-based implementation of the classic Tic-Tac-Toe game using C++. The game allows two players to compete, taking turns to mark positions on a 3x3 board. The player who succeeds in placing three of their marks in a horizontal, vertical, or diagonal row wins the game. If the board is filled without a winner, the game results in a draw.

How It Works

Player Setup:

Players enter their names at the start of the game.

Player 1 uses the symbol x, and Player 2 uses the symbol 0.

Game Flow:

The game alternates turns between the two players.

Players select a position on the board by entering a number between 1 and 9 corresponding to the desired position.

Win or Draw Detection:

The program checks for winning conditions (three in a row horizontally, vertically, or diagonally) after each move.

If the board is filled and no winner is determined, the game declares a draw.

Game End:

The game announces the winner or declares a draw and then exits.

Features

Dynamic Board Display: The board updates in real-time after each move.

Input Validation: Ensures players only select valid and unoccupied positions.

Win and Draw Detection: Detects winning combinations or a draw accurately.
